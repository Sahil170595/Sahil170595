## Abstract

TR131 established that GPU memory bandwidth saturation is the root cause of multi-agent throughput degradation, with Ollama losing 82% of per-agent throughput at N=8 and PyTorch Direct losing 86%. TR130 demonstrated that production serving stacks (vLLM and TGI) degrade only 39--56% under the same load -- a 26--44 percentage-point scaling advantage -- but lacked kernel-level evidence for *why*.

TR132 provides the causal mechanism. Using an in-container Nsight Systems profiling methodology that overcomes WSL2/WDDM CUDA visibility limitations, we captured CUPTI traces from inside Docker containers running vLLM and TGI. The approach mounts the Linux nsys binary into each container, wraps the server entrypoint with `nsys profile --trace cuda`, and extracts cross-platform `.nsys-rep` traces via volume mounts.

**The central finding: continuous batching amortizes kernel launches and memory bandwidth across concurrent requests.** At N=8, vLLM reduces per-token kernel count by 80% (from 55--77 kernels/token at N=1 to 11--15 at N=8, p < 10^-6, d > 600) and per-token memory operation time by 79--83% (p < 0.001, d > 21). This 4.7--5.8x bandwidth amortization directly explains the 26--44 percentage-point scaling advantage over Ollama (which cannot batch). TGI shows nearly identical amortization (4.7--4.8x), confirming that the mechanism is architectural -- continuous batching itself -- not implementation-specific.

Five hypotheses were tested:

- **H_1** (per-token kernel count reduces with batching): **CONFIRMED** across all 4 backend-model pairs (8/8 Holm-corrected tests significant).
- **H2** (per-token memory bandwidth reduces with batching): **CONFIRMED** (8/8 tests significant).
- **H3** (GPU utilization increases with batching): **REJECTED** -- the `--trace cuda` profile mode does not capture GPU metrics counters (0% utilization is a measurement limitation, not a finding).
- **H4** (attention kernel signatures differ between backends): **INCONCLUSIVE** -- kernel names were not reliably classifiable as PagedAttention vs FlashAttention.
- **H5** (serving stack N=1 matches PyTorch N=1): **INSUFFICIENT DATA** -- TR131 PyTorch data not available in cross-reference format.

*Methodological contribution:* The in-container nsys profiling technique developed for TR132 solves a fundamental limitation of GPU profiling under WSL2/Docker. This approach is reusable for any CUDA workload running in Docker containers on Windows hosts.

## Executive Summary

### Key Findings

1. **Continuous batching amortizes kernel launches by 77--80%.** At N=8, both vLLM and TGI reduce per-token kernel count by 77--80% compared to N=1. vLLM LLaMA-1B: 54.9 -> 10.9 kernels/token (80.2% reduction, p=5.3x10^-11, d=1058). This means 8 concurrent requests share kernel launches rather than each executing independently.

2. **Memory bandwidth per token drops 79--83%.** Per-token memory operation time follows the same pattern: vLLM LLaMA-1B drops from 1.27 ms/token to 0.22 ms/token (82.6% reduction, p=0.0002, d=21.6). This is the direct mechanism by which serving stacks avoid the bandwidth wall that crushes Ollama.

3. **The amortization ratio is 4.7--5.8x.** For 8x concurrent load, bandwidth per token reduces 4.7--5.8x. The ratio exceeds N/2 for the 1B model (5.75x with vLLM), indicating super-linear amortization from kernel fusion in the batched code path.

4. **vLLM and TGI show nearly identical amortization.** vLLM amortization: 4.68--5.75x. TGI amortization: 4.65--4.80x. The mechanism is continuous batching itself, not a vLLM-specific optimization. Both use CUTLASS/cuBLAS GEMM kernels that naturally batch matrix operations.

5. **vLLM is 27--35% faster than TGI at N=1.** vLLM LLaMA-1B: 106.3 TPS vs TGI: 83.7 TPS. vLLM LLaMA-3B: 50.8 TPS vs TGI: 41.9 TPS. The throughput gap narrows slightly at N=8 (22--23%), suggesting TGI's batching is comparably efficient but its single-request overhead is higher.

6. **GEMM kernels dominate GPU time.** vLLM spends 69--82% of GPU time in GEMM (matrix multiply) kernels. TGI spends 41--57%, with a larger attention component (22--32% vs 4--5% for vLLM). This reflects different attention implementations: vLLM uses PagedAttention, TGI uses a softmax-heavy attention path.

7. **Serving stacks use 15--25x more kernels than Ollama at N=1.** vLLM launches 35,129 kernels for LLaMA-1B N=1 vs Ollama's 2,257 (TR131). Despite this overhead, vLLM's kernel-level parallelism and continuous batching architecture yield superior scaling.

8. **Larger models amortize better under N=8.** LLaMA-3B degrades only 38.7--38.9% at N=8 (vLLM/TGI), vs 54.1--55.8% for LLaMA-1B. The scaling advantage over Ollama reaches 43.3--43.5% for the 3B model vs 26.3--28.0% for 1B.

9. **H3 (GPU utilization) rejected due to measurement limitation.** The `--trace cuda` profiling mode captures kernel launches and memory operations but not GPU metrics counters. GPU utilization reads 0% for all conditions -- this is a known nsys limitation when not using `--trace cuda,gpu_metric` (which requires admin/elevated permissions in containers).

10. **In-container nsys profiling achieves 100% trace capture rate.** All 24 profiled repetitions produced valid traces (11.6--17.4 MB each). The methodology is reliable and reusable.

**Claim Validation**

| # | Claim | Evidence | Status |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Serving stacks scale better due to "better scheduling" (TR130) | Kernel-level evidence shows kernel count and bandwidth both drop ~80% -- this is batched computation, not scheduling | **Reattributed** |
| 2 | Continuous batching reduces per-token kernel count (H_1) | 77--80% reduction, all p < 10^-6, d > 600, 4/4 Holm-significant | **Confirmed** |
| 3 | Continuous batching reduces per-token memory bandwidth (H2) | 79--83% reduction, all p < 0.001, d > 21, 4/4 Holm-significant | **Confirmed** |
| 4 | GPU utilization increases with batching (H3) | 0% utilization in all conditions -- `--trace cuda` does not capture GPU metrics | **Rejected (measurement)** |
| 5 | vLLM and TGI use different attention kernels (H4) | Kernel profiles differ structurally but names not classifiable as PagedAttention vs FlashAttention | **Inconclusive** |
| 6 | Serving stack N=1 overhead ~ PyTorch Direct (H5) | TR131 PyTorch data not available for cross-reference | **Insufficient data** |
| 7 | Profiling overhead distorts timing | vLLM N=1: 106.3 TPS (profiled) vs TR130 unprofiled ~110 TPS -- ~3% overhead | **Negligible** |
| 8 | Ollama's 82% degradation is a software bug | Confirmed by TR131 as GPU physics; TR132 shows serving stacks avoid it via batching, not better code | **Reattributed** |

### Key Decisions for Practitioners

1. **Continuous batching is the mechanism, not a specific implementation.** Both vLLM and TGI achieve nearly identical bandwidth amortization (4.7--5.8x). Choose between them based on operational factors (API compatibility, ecosystem), not batching efficiency.

2. **Larger models benefit more from serving stacks.** The 3B model loses only 39% throughput at N=8 (vs Ollama's 82%), giving a 43 pp scaling advantage. For 1B models, the advantage is 26--28 pp. The kernel-level evidence shows larger models have more amortizable GEMM operations.

3. **Ollama cannot compete at N>1.** With no batching mechanism, Ollama's 82% degradation at N=8 is a fundamental architectural limit, not a tuning issue. Every concurrent request executes a full independent kernel sequence.

4. **GPU utilization requires `--trace cuda,gpu_metric` with elevated permissions.** The `--trace cuda` mode alone does not capture SM occupancy or utilization counters. Future profiling should add `--gpu-metrics-set` inside the container (requires `--cap-add SYS_ADMIN`).

5. **In-container nsys profiling is production-ready.** 100% trace capture rate across 24 runs. The methodology (mount Linux nsys, symlink workaround, `/bin/sh -c` entrypoint) is reliable and reusable for any Docker-based GPU workload.

## SS1. Introduction and Motivation

### SS1.1 Background

The Banterhearts research program has progressively narrowed the diagnosis of multi-agent throughput degradation. TR129 measured the phenomenon: per-agent throughput drops 63% at N=8 concurrent agents (Amdahl serialization parameter s=0.39--0.54). TR130 compared serving stacks: vLLM and TGI degrade only 39--56% vs Ollama's 82%, establishing a 26--44 percentage-point scaling advantage for production serving stacks. TR131 identified the root cause at the GPU level: memory bandwidth saturation drives degradation, with kernel-level evidence from Ollama and PyTorch Direct.

TR132 completes the causal chain by answering: **what GPU-level mechanism gives serving stacks their scaling advantage?**

### SS1.2 Experimental Design

TR132 profiles vLLM and TGI at the GPU kernel level using an in-container Nsight Systems methodology. Two models (LLaMA-3.2-1B, LLaMA-3.2-3B) are tested at two concurrency levels (N=1, N=8) across two backends (vLLM, TGI), with 3 repetitions per condition (24 profiled runs total). Ollama baselines are cross-referenced from TR131.

| Factor | Controlled? | Value |
|--------|------------|-------|
| GPU hardware | Yes | RTX 4080 Laptop 12 GB, GDDR6, 432 GB/s peak |
| Models | Yes | LLaMA-3.2-1B (1.2B params), LLaMA-3.2-3B (3.2B params) |
| Concurrency levels | Yes | N=1 (baseline), N=8 (concurrent) |
| Max new tokens | Yes | 128 |
| Precision | Yes | FP16 (both backends) |
| Profiler | Yes | nsys 2025.5.1, in-container CUPTI |
| Repetitions | Yes | 3 per condition |
| Serving backend | **Variable** | vLLM vs TGI |
| Quantization | Controlled (FP16) | Ollama uses Q4_0 (cross-reference only) |

The quantization difference between serving stacks (FP16) and Ollama (Q4_0) affects absolute TPS but not the degradation ratio analysis. FP16 places strictly more memory pressure per parameter (4x), making the serving stack's better scaling even more remarkable -- they scale better despite higher per-parameter bandwidth demand.

### SS1.3 Literature Gap

Published LLM serving benchmarks (Kwon et al. 2023, Patel et al. 2024, Yu et al. 2022) evaluate continuous batching under open-loop arrival distributions (Poisson processes). Multi-agent systems are closed-loop: each agent waits for a response before sending the next request. TR130 provided the first closed-loop cross-backend comparison. TR131 went further by removing the serving stack entirely (PyTorch Direct), isolating GPU physics as the root cause of degradation.

However, neither TR130 nor TR131 measured the GPU-level mechanism by which serving stacks achieve their scaling advantage. The correlation between "uses continuous batching" and "scales better" was established, but the causal link -- specifically, that batching reduces per-token kernel launches and memory bandwidth -- was untested. TR132 closes this gap by profiling vLLM and TGI at the kernel level using in-container nsys, providing the first CUPTI-level evidence of continuous batching's bandwidth amortization effect in the Banterhearts research series.

### SS1.4 The WSL2/WDDM Challenge -- Why In-Container nsys

A critical technical obstacle blocked kernel profiling of Docker-based serving stacks. NVIDIA Nsight Systems on the Windows host cannot see CUDA kernels executing inside Docker containers. This is an architectural limitation of the WSL2/WDDM GPU virtualization layer -- confirmed by NVIDIA documentation. The host nsys process captures only GPU context switches, not individual kernel launches.

Three approaches were considered:

| Approach | Feasibility | Why Rejected/Selected |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Host nsys wrapping `docker run` | Infeasible | WDDM isolation: host nsys sees zero CUDA kernels from container processes |
| Admin/elevated nsys on host | Infeasible | WDDM is architectural -- admin does not bypass container GPU isolation |
| **In-container nsys (selected)** | **Works** | Mount Linux nsys binary, wrap server entrypoint, CUPTI injects inside container |

The in-container approach mounts `target-linux-x64/nsys` from the host Nsight Systems installation into the Docker container as a read-only volume. The server entrypoint is wrapped with `nsys profile --trace cuda`, placing CUPTI injection inside the container where it has direct access to the CUDA context. Traces are volume-mounted back to the host for cross-platform stats export (`.nsys-rep` is a cross-platform binary format).

This methodology is the primary technical contribution of TR132 beyond the hypothesis tests.

### SS1.5 Research Questions

1. **Q1:** Does continuous batching reduce per-token kernel launches? (H_1)
2. **Q2:** Does continuous batching reduce per-token memory bandwidth demand? (H2)
3. **Q3:** Does batched serving achieve higher GPU utilization? (H3)
4. **Q4:** Do vLLM (PagedAttention) and TGI (FlashAttention) have distinct kernel signatures? (H4)
5. **Q5:** Is serving-stack N=1 overhead comparable to raw PyTorch? (H5)

### SS1.6 Five Hypotheses

| H | Hypothesis | Rationale | Metric |
|---|-----------|-----------|--------|
| H_1 | Batching reduces per-token kernel count | Continuous batching fuses operations across requests | kernels_per_token N=1 vs N=8 |
| H2 | Batching reduces per-token memory bandwidth | Shared KV-cache reduces per-request memory transfers | mem_time_per_token N=1 vs N=8 |
| H3 | Batched serving achieves higher GPU utilization | Better scheduling should increase SM occupancy | gpu_utilization_pct N=1 vs N=8 |
| H4 | PagedAttention vs FlashAttention have distinct signatures | Different attention algorithms produce different kernel mixes | kernel name classification |
| H5 | vLLM/TGI N=1 ~ Ollama/PyTorch N=1 | Serving overhead should not change kernel physics | N=1 TPS and kernel count comparison |

## SS2. Methodology

### SS2.1 In-Container Profiling Architecture

The in-container nsys profiling pipeline:

1. **Mount Linux nsys** into the Docker container at `/nsys_root/target-linux-x64:ro`
2. **Create symlink**: nsys refuses to run directly from `target-linux-x64/` (NVIDIA installation convention). The entrypoint creates `ln -sf /nsys_root/target-linux-x64/nsys /tmp/nsys`
3. **Wrap server entrypoint**: `/tmp/nsys profile --trace cuda -o /traces/{name} -f true -- {server_cmd}`
4. **Volume-mount traces**: Host directory mounted at `/traces` for output
5. **Docker flags**: `--gpus all --init --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --security-opt seccomp=unconfined`
6. **Stop with timeout**: `docker stop -t 120` gives nsys time to finalize the trace
7. **Stats export**: Windows nsys binary reads the `.nsys-rep` file (cross-platform format)

The `--init` flag is critical: it inserts `tini` as PID 1, which properly forwards SIGTERM to nsys, allowing trace finalization on container stop.

### SS2.2 Container-Per-Rep Lifecycle

Each repetition starts a fresh profiled container. This captures the complete kernel sequence (warmup + workload) per rep, ensuring clean traces for statistical analysis. The warmup phase is 3 requests (vs 5 workload requests at N=1 or 24 total at N=8) -- a small fraction of total trace time.

### SS2.3 Backend as HTTP Client

The serving stack backend is used as an HTTP-only client. The NsysContainerDriver launches Docker directly with nsys wrapping. The `create_backend()` factory provides `wait_ready()`, `warmup()`, and `generate()` for HTTP API access only -- no `backend.start()` call.

### SS2.4 Metrics

| Metric | Source | Computation |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| TPS (tokens/sec) | Wall-clock timing | `completion_tokens / wall_time_s` |
| Kernels per token | nsys `cuda_gpu_kern_sum` | `total_kernel_launches / total_tokens` |
| Memory time per token (ms) | nsys `cuda_gpu_mem_time_sum` | `total_mem_op_time / total_tokens` |
| GPU utilization (%) | nsys GPU metrics | `gpu_busy_time / total_time` (requires `--trace gpu_metric`) |
| Kernel classification | nsys `cuda_gpu_kern_sum` | Name matching: `gemm` -> GEMM, `attention`/`softmax` -> Attention |

### SS2.5 Statistical Methods

- **Welch's t-test** for all N=1 vs N=8 comparisons (unequal variance assumption)
- **Cohen's d** (pooled) for effect size
- **Mann-Whitney U** as non-parametric confirmation
- **Holm step-down correction** for 12 simultaneous tests (4 backend-model pairs x 3 hypotheses)
- **N=3 reps per condition**: minimum detectable Cohen's d ~ 4.3 (only very large effects)

### SS2.6 Five Phases

| Phase | Description | Reps | Traces |
|-------|-------------|------|--------|
| 1 | Validation gate (vLLM, 3 requests, verify kernel capture) | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | vLLM profiled: 2 models x 2 N-levels x 3 reps | 12 | 12 |
| 3 | TGI profiled: 2 models x 2 N-levels x 3 reps | 12 | 12 |
| 4 | TR131 cross-reference (load Ollama baselines) | -- | -- |
| 5 | Analysis (hypothesis tests, bandwidth amortization) | -- | -- |

## SS3. Phase 1 -- Environment Validation

### SS3.1 Validation Results

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Windows nsys reachable | Yes (v2025.5.1.121) |
| Linux nsys directory exists | Yes |
| Docker available | Yes (v28.5.1) |
| Container started | Yes |
| Server ready | Yes |
| Warmup (3 requests) | 3/3 OK |
| Test requests (3) | 3/3 OK |

**Validation request performance:**

| Seq | Status | Wall (ms) | Tokens | TPS |
|-----|--------|-----------|--------|-----|
| 0 | OK | 999.8 | 128 | 128.0 |
| 1 | OK | 986.3 | 128 | 129.8 |
| 2 | OK | 990.6 | 128 | 129.2 |

**Trace capture:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Trace file | `p1_validation.nsys-rep` |
| Trace size | 13.59 MB |
| Kernel count | 33,302 |
| GPU time | 4,888.3 ms |
| Kernel launches | 33,302 |

### SS3.2 Observations

**Observation 1 -- Validation gate passed with high kernel density.** 33,302 kernels captured from 3 requests confirms that in-container CUPTI injection is working correctly. This is ~11,000 kernels per request -- consistent with the serving stack overhead observed in Phase 2.

**Observation 2 -- Trace files are substantial.** At 13.59 MB for 3 requests, the traces contain rich kernel-level data. This confirms that `--trace cuda` captures the full CUDA API call graph, not just summary statistics.

**Observation 3 -- GPU utilization reads 0%.** This is expected: `--trace cuda` does not enable GPU metric counters. The utilization metric requires `--trace cuda,gpu_metric` which needs additional permissions. This limitation applies to all subsequent phases (SS10).

**Observation 4 -- Validation TPS (128.0--129.8) is lower than Ollama's N=1 (160.4 TPS from TR131).** This is expected: vLLM serves FP16 models (2 bytes/param) while Ollama serves Q4_0 (0.6 bytes/param), so vLLM reads ~3.3x more weight data per token. The 20% lower TPS at N=1 is the cost of FP16 precision -- a cost that is more than recovered by continuous batching at N>=2 (SS6).

**Observation 5 -- The symlink workaround works reliably.** nsys refuses to execute directly from `target-linux-x64/` (an NVIDIA installation convention). The entrypoint creates `ln -sf /nsys_root/target-linux-x64/nsys /tmp/nsys` and invokes `/tmp/nsys`. This workaround was discovered during TR132 development and is documented here for reproducibility. Without it, nsys exits with error code 1 and produces no trace.

**Gate: PASSED.** All 5 nsys report types (cuda_api_sum, cuda_gpu_kern_sum, cuda_gpu_mem_time_sum, cuda_kern_exec_trace, osrt_sum) extracted successfully. 33,302 kernels confirm full CUPTI visibility. Proceeding to profiled phases.

### SS4.4 Observations

**Observation 1 -- vLLM shows extremely low variance.** CV% ranges from 0.21% to 0.54% across all conditions. The container-per-rep methodology produces highly reproducible traces, confirming that serving stack throughput is deterministic when hardware is isolated. For comparison, Ollama's N=8 CV was 5.4--7.5% (TR131) -- 10--25x higher.

**Observation 2 -- Larger models degrade less.** LLaMA-3B degrades 38.7% vs 55.8% for LLaMA-1B. The 3B model has more amortizable GEMM operations (larger weight matrices with more rows per layer), making continuous batching relatively more efficient. This aligns with the theoretical expectation: batching amortizes fixed per-kernel overhead, and larger kernels have proportionally less overhead.

**Observation 3 -- N=8 variance is even lower than N=1.** The N=8 CV% (0.21--0.31%) is consistently lower than N=1 (0.48--0.54%), suggesting that batched inference smooths out per-request variability. With 8 agents generating tokens, the aggregate workload is more stable -- individual request timing jitter averages out.

**Observation 4 -- Kernel counts are nearly identical between N=1 and N=8.** LLaMA-1B: 35,129 kernels at N=1 vs 33,346 at N=8 (-5%). LLaMA-3B: 49,094 at N=1 vs 47,388 at N=8 (-3.5%). This is the kernel-level signature of continuous batching: 8x more tokens are processed with roughly the *same* number of kernel launches. The kernels get larger (more rows in each GEMM), not more numerous.

**Observation 5 -- GPU time is approximately constant between N=1 and N=8.** LLaMA-1B: 5,221 ms (N=1) vs 4,805 ms (N=8). LLaMA-3B: 9,630 ms (N=1) vs 9,078 ms (N=8). Despite processing 4.8x more tokens at N=8, the total GPU compute time *decreases* slightly. This is the amortization in action: GEMM kernels with 8x more rows are only marginally slower than single-row GEMMs because they better utilize the GPU's parallel compute units.

**Observation 6 -- Trace sizes are consistent (~14--17 MB).** Unlike TR131's PyTorch traces that grew to 76--270 MB, serving stack traces remain compact. This reflects the dramatically lower kernel count -- 35,000 kernels vs 900,000+ for PyTorch Direct (TR131 SS6). Fewer kernel launches means less CUPTI event data.

### SS4.5 Interpretation -- The Amortization Signature

The per-rep data reveals the fundamental signature of continuous batching at the kernel level. Consider LLaMA-1B: at N=1, vLLM launches 35,094--35,154 kernels to generate 640 tokens (5 requests x 128 tokens). At N=8, it launches 33,263--33,457 kernels to generate 3,072 tokens (8 agents x 3 requests x 128 tokens). The per-token kernel count drops from 54.9 to 10.9 -- an 80% reduction.

This means continuous batching does not execute 8 independent inference sequences. It fuses the 8 concurrent requests into shared GEMM operations. Where N=1 dispatches a weight matrix x single input vector multiply, N=8 dispatches a weight matrix x 8-row input matrix multiply -- a single, wider GEMM kernel. The weight matrix is read from VRAM once, not 8 times. This is the bandwidth amortization mechanism that TR131's physics analysis predicted and TR132 now confirms at the kernel level.

### SS5.4 Observations

**Observation 1 -- TGI throughput is consistently below vLLM.** TGI achieves 79--82% of vLLM's throughput at N=1 and 80--82% at N=8. The gap is consistent across both models, suggesting a fixed overhead difference in TGI's serving infrastructure (its Rust-based request router and attention implementation) rather than a scaling efficiency difference.

**Observation 2 -- TGI kernel counts are perfectly deterministic at N=1.** All three reps produce exactly 46,705 kernels (LLaMA-1B) and 55,663 kernels (LLaMA-3B) with zero variance (std=0.0). TGI's execution graph is fully deterministic for single-request inference -- identical tokenization produces identical kernel sequences. This determinism provides an extremely clean baseline for N=1 vs N=8 comparison.

**Observation 3 -- TGI's kernel count *increases* at N=8 (unlike vLLM).** LLaMA-1B: 46,705 -> 52,594 (+12.6%). LLaMA-3B: 55,663 -> 61,871 (+11.2%). This is the opposite of vLLM's pattern (-5%). TGI adds batching-related overhead kernels (scheduling, attention mask computation) that do not appear in the single-request path. Despite this, per-token kernel count still drops 77% because total tokens increase 4.8x.

**Observation 4 -- TGI degradation matches vLLM almost exactly.** TGI degrades 54.1% for 1B (vs vLLM 55.8%) and 38.9% for 3B (vs vLLM 38.7%). The degradation patterns are model-driven, not backend-driven -- both backends hit the same GPU bandwidth wall, and both amortize it with the same continuous batching mechanism.

**Observation 5 -- TGI's GPU time is dramatically lower than vLLM.** LLaMA-1B N=1: TGI 960 ms vs vLLM 5,221 ms (5.4x difference). This likely reflects a measurement artifact: vLLM's trace captures model loading and PagedAttention initialization within the profiling window, while TGI's Rust-based launcher completes initialization before the Python-visible CUDA context starts.

**Observation 6 -- TGI's memory time per token is higher than vLLM.** LLaMA-1B N=1: TGI 2.01 ms/token vs vLLM 1.27 ms/token (58% higher). LLaMA-3B N=1: TGI 5.21 ms/token vs vLLM 3.47 ms/token (50% higher). TGI's explicit softmax and reduce kernels (SS7) generate additional memory traffic compared to vLLM's fused attention path.

### SS5.5 Interpretation -- TGI vs vLLM Architecture

TGI and vLLM implement continuous batching differently at the kernel level, but achieve nearly identical amortization. vLLM's PagedAttention fuses attention computation into fewer, larger kernels -- resulting in lower kernel counts, lower memory time, but higher total GPU time (due to model loading captured in trace). TGI uses a traditional softmax-based attention path that generates more kernels (especially `cunn_SoftMaxForward` and `reduce_kernel`) but achieves the same net bandwidth reduction.

The practical implication: **batching efficiency is not a differentiator between these backends.** Both achieve 4.7--5.8x bandwidth amortization. The 20% throughput gap favoring vLLM is a constant-factor difference (likely attention implementation efficiency), not a scaling difference. For practitioners choosing between vLLM and TGI, the decision should be based on ecosystem factors (API compatibility, deployment tooling), not batching performance.

| vLLM | 106.33 | 46.99 | -55.8% | 0.442 |

|---------|---------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Ollama (TR131) | 96.48 | 17.19 | -82.2% | 0.178 |
| vLLM | 50.81 | 31.13 | -38.7% | 0.613 |
| TGI | 41.92 | 25.62 | -38.9% | 0.611 |

### SS6.2 Bandwidth Demand -- Back-of-Envelope Physics

The RTX 4080 Laptop GPU has a peak memory bandwidth of 432 GB/s. Each token generation requires reading the full model weights from VRAM. The bandwidth demand per agent scales linearly with TPS and model weight size.

**FP16 weight sizes:**
- LLaMA-3.2-1B: 1.2B params x 2 bytes = **2.4 GB**
- LLaMA-3.2-3B: 3.2B params x 2 bytes = **6.4 GB**

**Bandwidth demand at N=1 (single agent):**

| Backend | Model | TPS | Weight Reads/s | BW Demand (GB/s) | % of Peak (432 GB/s) |
|---------|-------|-----|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| vLLM | LLaMA-1B | 106.3 | 106.3 | 255.1 | 59.1% |
| vLLM | LLaMA-3B | 50.8 | 50.8 | 325.1 | 75.3% |
| TGI | LLaMA-1B | 83.7 | 83.7 | 200.9 | 46.5% |
| TGI | LLaMA-3B | 41.9 | 41.9 | 268.2 | 62.1% |
| Ollama (Q4_0) | LLaMA-1B | 160.4 | 160.4 | 96.2* | 22.3%* |

*Ollama uses Q4_0 (0.6 bytes/param), so its weight size is 0.72 GB for 1B -- much lower bandwidth demand per token.

**Bandwidth demand at N=8 without batching (Ollama model):**

| Backend | Model | Aggregate TPS | BW Demand (GB/s) | % of Peak | Oversubscribed? |
|---------|-------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Ollama (Q4_0) | LLaMA-1B | 230.4 (8x28.8) | 138.2 | 32.0% | No, but serialized |
| Ollama (Q4_0) | LLaMA-3B | 137.5 (8x17.2) | 158.4 | 36.7% | No, but serialized |

**Bandwidth demand at N=8 with batching (vLLM/TGI model):**

| Backend | Model | Aggregate TPS | BW Amortization | Effective BW (GB/s) | % of Peak |
|---------|-------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| vLLM | LLaMA-1B | 375.9 (8x47.0) | 5.75x | 156.8 | 36.3% |
| vLLM | LLaMA-3B | 249.1 (8x31.1) | 4.68x | 341.0 | 78.9% |
| TGI | LLaMA-1B | 307.3 (8x38.4) | 4.65x | 158.6 | 36.7% |
| TGI | LLaMA-3B | 204.9 (8x25.6) | 4.80x | 273.1 | 63.2% |

**Interpretation:** Without batching, each of 8 agents would demand 8x the N=1 bandwidth -- vastly exceeding the 432 GB/s peak. With batching, the weight matrix is read once per batch iteration (not once per request), reducing effective bandwidth demand by 4.7--5.8x. This keeps the GPU's memory controller below saturation for the 1B model and near-saturation for the 3B model -- explaining why the 3B model degrades less (it's already near the bandwidth wall at N=1, so the relative increase at N=8 is smaller).

### SS6.3 Observations

**Observation 1 -- Ollama is fastest at N=1 but worst at N=8.** Ollama's 160 TPS at N=1 (LLaMA-1B) reflects two advantages: minimal serving overhead (wraps `llama.cpp` directly) and Q4_0 quantization (4x less bandwidth per parameter). But without batching, it collapses to 28.8 TPS at N=8 (below vLLM's 47.0). The Q4_0 bandwidth advantage is overwhelmed by the lack of kernel-level amortization.

**Observation 2 -- The scaling crossover confirms the batching hypothesis.** At N=1, Ollama > vLLM > TGI. At N=8, vLLM > TGI > Ollama. The crossover occurs between N=1 and N=8, exactly where continuous batching activates. This is not a gradual improvement -- it is a phase transition from sequential to batched execution.

**Observation 3 -- vLLM and TGI scaling ratios are nearly identical per model.** LLaMA-1B: 0.442 vs 0.459. LLaMA-3B: 0.613 vs 0.611. The mechanism (continuous batching) is the same; only the constant overhead differs. This rules out the hypothesis that one backend has a fundamentally better batching algorithm.

**Observation 4 -- Model size is the dominant scaling factor.** The 3B model retains 61% of per-agent throughput at N=8 (scaling ratio 0.61) vs 44--46% for 1B. Larger GEMM operations amortize more effectively -- a 3200xhidden matmul with 8 batched inputs is proportionally cheaper to launch than a 1200xhidden matmul with 8 inputs, because the CUDA launch overhead is amortized over more compute.

**Observation 5 -- The 3B model's better scaling defies naive expectation.** Naively, larger models should degrade *more* under concurrency because they demand more bandwidth. But continuous batching inverts this: larger models have more to amortize. The 3B model's GEMM kernels are compute-bound (more FLOPs per weight byte), while the 1B model's are memory-bound (fewer FLOPs per weight byte). Batching converts memory-bound kernels into compute-bound kernels by increasing the batch dimension -- and this conversion is more effective when there is more compute to convert.

**Observation 6 -- The aggregate throughput advantage of serving stacks is enormous.** At N=8, vLLM delivers 376 tokens/sec total (LLaMA-1B) vs Ollama's 230. For LLaMA-3B, vLLM delivers 249 vs Ollama's 138 -- an 80% throughput advantage. This is the practical impact of bandwidth amortization.

### SS7.3 Observations

**Observation 1 -- vLLM is GEMM-dominated; TGI is attention-heavy.** vLLM spends 69--82% of GPU time in GEMM kernels, while TGI spends only 41--57%. The difference is accounted for by TGI's 22--32% attention kernel fraction vs vLLM's 4--5%.

**Observation 2 -- TGI uses explicit softmax kernels.** TGI's top kernel is `cunn_SoftMaxForward` (1,299 ms, 10,380 instances), suggesting a traditional scaled dot-product attention implementation. vLLM does not show prominent softmax kernels, consistent with fused attention (PagedAttention).

**Observation 3 -- Both backends use CUTLASS/cuBLAS GEMM kernels.** The `cutlass_80_wmma_tensorop` and `ampere_fp16_s1688gemm` kernels appear in both backends. These are NVIDIA's optimized matrix multiply implementations that naturally batch across rows.

**Observation 4 -- vLLM has a high-frequency utility kernel.** The `vectorized_elementwise_kernel<FillFunctor>` (15,410 instances, 2,708 ms) is a memory initialization kernel that dominates vLLM's kernel count. This is likely PagedAttention's block table initialization -- clearing KV-cache blocks before reuse.

**Observation 5 -- GEMM fraction increases with model size for vLLM.** vLLM LLaMA-1B: 68.9% GEMM. vLLM LLaMA-3B: 82.2% GEMM. Larger models have proportionally more GEMM operations because the MLP feed-forward layers (which are pure matmul) scale with hidden dimension squared, while attention scales with sequence length. This explains why larger models amortize better under batching (SS8, SS12) -- there are more GEMM operations to fuse.

**Observation 6 -- TGI's attention fraction is nearly constant across model sizes.** TGI LLaMA-1B: 31.6% attention. TGI LLaMA-3B: 22.5% attention. While the absolute fraction decreases slightly (as GEMM grows), TGI consistently shows 5--8x more attention kernel time than vLLM. This is structural: TGI's attention implementation dispatches separate softmax and reduce kernels, while vLLM's fused attention combines these into the GEMM pipeline.

### SS7.4 Interpretation -- What Kernel Profiles Reveal About Architecture

The kernel signature comparison reveals a fundamental architectural difference. vLLM's PagedAttention fuses attention computation into the GEMM pipeline -- attention is not visible as separate kernels because it is computed within the same kernel launch as the QKV projection. TGI uses a more traditional path: separate `cunn_SoftMaxForward` (softmax across attention scores), `reduce_kernel` (attention-weighted value aggregation), and CUTLASS GEMM (projection) kernels.

Neither approach is strictly better. vLLM's fusion reduces kernel launch overhead and intermediate memory traffic (fewer kernels = fewer VRAM round-trips). TGI's explicit decomposition may offer more flexibility for future optimization (each stage can be independently tuned). The practical consequence is that vLLM achieves ~20% higher throughput at N=1 (SS4 vs SS5), but the batching amortization is nearly identical (SS12) -- the fusion helps constant-factor performance but does not change the scaling physics.

### SS7.5 Verdict

**H4 INCONCLUSIVE.** While the kernel profiles show clear structural differences (GEMM-dominated vs attention-heavy), we could not reliably classify kernels as "PagedAttention" vs "FlashAttention" from names alone. The attention type field shows "unknown" for all models. A targeted Nsight Compute analysis with source correlation would be needed to definitively attribute kernel implementations to specific attention algorithms.

### SS8.1 Per-Token Kernel Count

|---------|-------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|------------|-----------|

| H_1 TGI LLaMA-3B | 5.52x10^-7 | 1,099.1 | **Large** | **Yes** |

### SS8.3 Observations

**Observation 1 -- Kernel count reduction is remarkably consistent at ~80%.** All four backend-model pairs show 76.5--80.2% reduction in per-token kernel count from N=1 to N=8. This consistency across both backends and both model sizes confirms that the amortization mechanism is fundamental to continuous batching.

**Observation 2 -- Effect sizes are astronomical.** Cohen's d values range from 605 to 26,269 -- orders of magnitude beyond the "large" threshold (0.8). The N=1 and N=8 kernel counts occupy entirely non-overlapping distributions.

**Observation 3 -- TGI has zero variance in N=1 kernel count.** TGI's N=1 kernels/token shows std=0.0 for both models. This means TGI executes an identical kernel sequence for every single-request inference -- perfectly deterministic at the kernel level.

**Observation 4 -- The ~80% reduction for 8x concurrency implies ~5:1 amortization.** If kernels scaled linearly with requests, N=8 would have the same per-token count as N=1. The 80% reduction means 8 requests share roughly the kernel budget of 1.6 requests -- a 5:1 amortization.

### SS8.4 Interpretation -- The 5:1 Amortization

The kernel count data reveals the most striking finding of TR132. Consider the arithmetic: at N=8, if each request executed independently, the per-token kernel count would remain at ~55 (vLLM LLaMA-1B). Instead, it drops to ~11 -- meaning 8 requests share a kernel budget that would serve only ~1.6 independent requests. This 5:1 ratio is the kernel-level signature of continuous batching.

The mechanism is straightforward: instead of 8 separate matrix multiplications `W x x1, W x x2, ..., W x x8`, the serving stack concatenates inputs into a single batch: `W x [x1; x2; ...; x8]`. This is one GEMM call instead of 8. The weight matrix W is read from VRAM once, not 8 times. Each CUDA kernel launch has fixed overhead (dispatch, memory barrier, synchronization) -- batching amortizes this across all 8 requests.

The amortization is not perfectly 8:1 because:
1. **Not all operations batch equally.** Attention kernels, layer norms, and activation functions often process sequences independently.
2. **Prefill vs decode phases differ.** Prefill (processing input tokens) and decode (generating output tokens) have different batch efficiency.
3. **KV-cache management adds overhead.** PagedAttention (vLLM) and FlashAttention variants add block table management kernels that scale with batch size.
4. **Scheduling overhead.** The continuous batching scheduler itself requires GPU operations for sequence tracking and token sampling.

Despite these inefficiencies, the net amortization of 4.7--5.8x is remarkably high -- capturing 59--72% of the theoretical maximum 8x amortization.

### SS8.5 Verdict

**H_1 CONFIRMED.** Continuous batching reduces per-token kernel count by 77--80% at N=8. All 4 tests are significant after Holm correction (all p < 10^-6). The direction is confirmed in every case. Continuous batching fuses kernel launches across concurrent requests.

## SS9. Memory Bandwidth Analysis (H2)

### SS9.1 Per-Token Memory Operation Time

| Backend | Model | N=1 ms/Token | N=1 95% CI | N=8 ms/Token | N=8 95% CI | Change |
|---------|-------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|--------|
| vLLM | LLaMA-1B | 1.274 | [1.117, 1.432] | 0.222 | [0.154, 0.290] | -82.6% |
| vLLM | LLaMA-3B | 3.473 | [3.366, 3.579] | 0.743 | [0.672, 0.813] | -78.6% |

| TGI | LLaMA-3B | 5.205 | [5.071, 5.340] | 1.084 | [1.035, 1.134] | -79.2% |

### SS9.2 Statistical Tests

| Test | p-value | Cohen's d | Effect | Holm Sig. |
|------|---------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| H2 vLLM LLaMA-1B | 2.32x10^-4 | 21.6 | **Large** | **Yes** |

| H2 TGI LLaMA-3B | 7.38x10^-6 | 100.9 | **Large** | **Yes** |

### SS9.3 Observations

**Observation 1 -- Memory bandwidth reduction mirrors kernel count reduction.** The 79--83% reduction in per-token memory time closely tracks the 77--80% kernel count reduction (SS8). This tight coupling is expected: each kernel launch triggers a weight matrix read from VRAM, so fewer kernels means proportionally fewer memory transfers. The correlation coefficient between kernel reduction and bandwidth reduction across the 4 backend-model pairs is >0.95.

**Observation 2 -- Larger models have higher absolute memory demand.** LLaMA-3B uses 3.47--5.21 ms/token of memory time at N=1 vs 1.27--2.01 ms/token for LLaMA-1B. The ratio (2.6--2.7x) closely tracks the parameter count ratio (3.2B/1.2B = 2.67x). This linear scaling confirms that memory time is dominated by weight reads -- the weight matrix size is proportional to parameter count.

**Observation 3 -- vLLM achieves slightly better memory amortization than TGI.** vLLM's bandwidth reduction is 78.6--82.6% vs TGI's 78.5--79.2%. The difference is small but consistent, suggesting vLLM's PagedAttention may achieve marginally better memory access patterns through its virtual-memory-style KV-cache management -- reducing fragmentation-induced extra reads.

**Observation 4 -- TGI's absolute memory demand is higher.** TGI uses 50--58% more memory time per token than vLLM at N=1 (2.01 vs 1.27 for 1B; 5.21 vs 3.47 for 3B). This correlates with TGI's attention-heavy kernel profile (SS7) -- explicit `cunn_SoftMaxForward` and `reduce_kernel` operations generate additional memory traffic that vLLM's fused attention avoids.

**Observation 5 -- The bandwidth reduction is the strongest evidence for the batching mechanism.** Memory bandwidth is a physical quantity -- it directly measures bytes transferred over the memory bus. The 79--83% reduction in per-token memory time is not an artifact of scheduling or measurement; it reflects 4.7--5.8x fewer bytes read from VRAM per generated token. This is the causal mechanism: continuous batching reduces bandwidth demand, and reduced bandwidth demand enables higher throughput under concurrency.

**Observation 6 -- Cross-referencing with TR131 completes the picture.** TR131 showed Ollama's memory operation time *increases* 74.4% from N=1 to N=8 (p=6.4x10^-5). TR132 shows serving stacks' memory operation time *decreases* 79--83% per token from N=1 to N=8. The mechanisms are opposite: Ollama serializes independent weight reads (more total bandwidth); serving stacks batch weight reads (less bandwidth per token). This bandwidth divergence -- increasing for Ollama, decreasing for serving stacks -- is the kernel-level explanation for the 26--44 pp scaling advantage measured in TR130.

### SS9.4 Verdict

**H2 CONFIRMED.** Continuous batching reduces per-token memory bandwidth demand by 79--83% at N=8. All 4 tests are significant after Holm correction (all p < 0.001). This directly explains the scaling advantage: batched requests share weight reads and KV-cache accesses, reducing the bandwidth demand that TR131 identified as the root cause of degradation.

## SS10. GPU Utilization Analysis (H3)

### SS10.1 Results

| Backend | Model | N=1 Util% | N=8 Util% | Max Concurrent Kernels (N=8) |
|---------|-------|-----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| vLLM | LLaMA-1B | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 |
| vLLM | LLaMA-3B | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 |
| TGI | LLaMA-1B | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 |
| TGI | LLaMA-3B | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 |

### SS10.2 Why Utilization Reads Zero

The `--trace cuda` profiling mode captures CUDA API calls, kernel launches, and memory operations via CUPTI injection. It does **not** enable GPU performance counter sampling, which requires `--trace cuda,gpu_metric` (or the separate `--gpu-metrics-set` flag). GPU utilization is a derived metric from SM activity counters -- these were not collected.

Additionally, in-container profiling with `--cap-add SYS_ADMIN` provides perf_event access for the CUDA context, but GPU-level metrics require the host GPU driver's metric collection interface, which may be further isolated by WSL2/WDDM.

### SS10.3 Max Concurrent Kernels

The maximum concurrent kernel count of 1.0 across all conditions means that at the resolution of nsys trace capture, kernel execution appears serialized. This is expected for inference workloads: transformer layers execute sequentially, and continuous batching fuses requests into larger single kernels rather than running multiple small kernels concurrently.

### SS10.4 Observations

**Observation 1 -- Max concurrent kernels = 1 matches TR131's finding.** TR131 found max_concurrent_kernels = 1 for both Ollama and PyTorch Direct across all 26 runs (Cohen's d = 0 for every comparison). TR132 extends this to vLLM and TGI: kernel serialization is universal across all four backends tested in the Banterhearts program. The GPU hardware enforces serial execution of full-width transformer kernels regardless of software.

**Observation 2 -- The 0% utilization is a measurement artifact, not a physical finding.** GPU utilization is computed as `gpu_busy_time / total_trace_time`. With `--trace cuda`, nsys does not record GPU busy/idle transitions, so the numerator is always 0. In reality, serving stacks likely achieve high utilization during active inference -- the GEMM kernels occupy all SMs for their duration. This metric should not be interpreted as "the GPU is idle."

**Observation 3 -- Continuous batching achieves amortization via wider kernels, not concurrent kernels.** The max_concurrent=1 result clarifies how batching works: it does not launch multiple small kernels in parallel. Instead, it widens each kernel to process more rows (batch dimension). A single GEMM kernel with batch=8 is one kernel launch that keeps all SMs busy longer, not 8 kernel launches running simultaneously. This is consistent with the 80% kernel count reduction (SS8) -- fewer launches, not more parallelism.

### SS10.5 Verdict

**H3 REJECTED.** GPU utilization data is unavailable due to the `--trace cuda` profiling mode limitation. No utilization change can be observed (0% in all conditions). The hypothesis cannot be tested with the current profiling configuration. Future work should explore `--trace cuda,gpu_metric` inside the container (which may require additional driver-level permissions). However, the max_concurrent_kernels = 1 finding across all conditions provides indirect evidence that batching works through kernel widening, not kernel concurrency.

## SS11. Baseline Overhead Comparison (H5)

### SS11.1 N=1 Cross-Backend Comparison

**LLaMA-3.2-1B**

| Backend | N=1 TPS | N=1 GPU Time (ms) | N=1 Kernels |
|---------|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| Ollama (TR131) | 160.44 | 45.90 | 2,257 |
| TGI | 96.20 | 959.83 | 46,705 |
| vLLM | 129.36 | 5,221.14 | 35,129 |

**LLaMA-3.2-3B**

| Backend | N=1 TPS | N=1 GPU Time (ms) | N=1 Kernels |
|---------|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| Ollama (TR131) | 96.48 | 118.91 | 3,949 |
| TGI | 44.98 | 1,567.83 | 55,663 |
| vLLM | 55.36 | 9,630.21 | 49,094 |

### SS11.2 Observations

**Observation 1 -- Serving stacks launch 15--25x more kernels than Ollama at N=1.** vLLM: 35,129 kernels (LLaMA-1B) vs Ollama: 2,257. TGI: 46,705 vs Ollama: 2,257. The serving stack overhead is enormous in terms of kernel count.

**Observation 2 -- vLLM's GPU time is 114x Ollama's for LLaMA-1B.** vLLM: 5,221 ms vs Ollama: 45.9 ms. This suggests vLLM's CUDA trace captures the full model loading and warmup process within the trace window, while Ollama's trace (from TR131's system-wide capture) may capture only the inference kernels.

**Observation 3 -- Despite kernel overhead, vLLM achieves 81% of Ollama's N=1 TPS.** vLLM: 129.4 TPS vs Ollama: 160.4 TPS for LLaMA-1B. The extra kernels add ~19% overhead at N=1, which is more than recovered by the batching advantage at N>=2.

**Observation 4 -- TGI has higher kernel count but lower GPU time than vLLM.** TGI launches 46,705 kernels with 960 ms GPU time (20.5 us/kernel) vs vLLM's 35,129 kernels with 5,221 ms GPU time (148.6 us/kernel). vLLM's kernels are much longer-running on average, consistent with fused attention operations that combine multiple computation stages into a single kernel launch.

**Observation 5 -- The kernel count gap narrows at 3B.** LLaMA-1B: vLLM has 35,129 kernels vs TGI's 46,705 (TGI is 1.33x higher). LLaMA-3B: vLLM has 49,094 vs TGI's 55,663 (TGI is 1.13x higher). As model size grows, both backends converge on a similar kernel count because the model-proportional GEMM kernels dominate over the architecture-specific attention and utility kernels.

**Observation 6 -- Ollama's extreme kernel efficiency comes from ggml fusion.** Ollama's 2,257 kernels for LLaMA-1B (vs 35,129 for vLLM) reflect ggml's `mul_mat_q` fused kernels (TR131 SS4). Each ggml kernel performs dequantization + matrix multiplication in a single launch. Serving stacks use separate dequant/compute passes (or run in FP16 natively), multiplying the kernel count. This is a fundamental architectural difference: ggml is optimized for minimal kernel overhead on a single request; serving stacks are optimized for maximal batching efficiency across concurrent requests.

### SS11.3 Interpretation -- The N=1 Overhead Tradeoff

The baseline overhead comparison reveals a critical tradeoff in serving stack design. At N=1, vLLM and TGI pay a substantial overhead: 15--25x more kernel launches and 60--80% of Ollama's throughput. This overhead comes from:

1. **FP16 vs Q4_0**: FP16 reads 3.3x more weight data per token (2 bytes vs 0.6 bytes per parameter).
2. **Unfused operations**: Separate kernels for attention, normalization, activation, and GEMM (vs ggml's fused approach).
3. **PagedAttention/KV-cache management**: Block table initialization, memory allocation tracking, and cache bookkeeping.
4. **Continuous batching scheduler**: Sequence tracking, token sampling, and batch formation -- even for a single request.

This overhead is the *cost* of enabling continuous batching. At N=1, it is pure waste -- Ollama is 24--66% faster. But at N>=2, the batching advantage compounds: each additional concurrent request adds minimal kernel overhead (because requests are fused into existing GEMM calls), while Ollama adds a full independent kernel sequence per request. The crossover point where serving stacks overtake Ollama in total throughput is between N=1 and N=2 (SS6).

### SS11.4 Verdict

**H5 INSUFFICIENT DATA.** TR131 PyTorch Direct N=1 data was not available in the cross-reference dataset. The comparison with Ollama shows substantial overhead (15--25x more kernels), but a PyTorch Direct comparison would be needed to determine whether this overhead is from the serving stack software or from the containerized execution environment. The Ollama comparison is further confounded by the Q4_0 vs FP16 quantization difference.

## SS12. Bandwidth Amortization and Scaling Advantage

### SS12.1 Amortization Analysis

The bandwidth amortization ratio measures how effectively continuous batching reduces per-token memory demand as concurrency increases.

| Backend | Model | Amortization Ratio | BW Saving% | TPS Degrade% | Advantage vs Ollama |
|---------|-------|--------------------|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| vLLM | LLaMA-1B | **5.75x** | 82.6% | 55.8% | **+26.3 pp** |
| vLLM | LLaMA-3B | **4.68x** | 78.6% | 38.7% | **+43.5 pp** |
| TGI | LLaMA-1B | **4.65x** | 78.5% | 54.1% | **+28.0 pp** |
| TGI | LLaMA-3B | **4.80x** | 79.2% | 38.9% | **+43.3 pp** |

### SS12.2 Observations

**Observation 1 -- vLLM achieves super-linear amortization for LLaMA-1B.** With 8x concurrency, vLLM achieves 5.75x bandwidth amortization -- exceeding N/2 (4.0x). This suggests that the batched code path activates more efficient kernel fusion beyond simple request aggregation.

**Observation 2 -- Amortization ratios are similar across backends.** vLLM: 4.68--5.75x. TGI: 4.65--4.80x. The mechanism is continuous batching, not a backend-specific optimization.

**Observation 3 -- Scaling advantage grows with model size.** For LLaMA-3B, the advantage over Ollama is 43.3--43.5 pp (vs 26.3--28.0 pp for 1B). Larger models have more GEMM operations per token (more layers, wider dimensions), providing more opportunity for batched kernel fusion.

**Observation 4 -- The bandwidth saving directly explains the throughput advantage.** Ollama degrades 82% at N=8 because each of 8 requests reads the full weight matrices independently. vLLM/TGI degrade only 39--56% because they fuse 8 requests into shared GEMM operations, reading weights once for all requests in a batch iteration.

**Observation 5 -- The amortization ratio provides an upper bound on scaling improvement.** If bandwidth amortization were the *only* factor, a 5.75x amortization would reduce degradation from 82% (Ollama) to ~14%. The actual 56% degradation for vLLM LLaMA-1B is worse than this theoretical limit because: (a) not all operations batch equally (attention, layer norms), (b) prefill vs decode phases have different efficiency, and (c) batch scheduling adds its own overhead. The gap between theoretical and actual (14% vs 56%) represents the non-amortizable fraction of the workload.

### SS12.3 Interpretation -- Why Amortization Is Not 8:1

The theoretical maximum amortization for N=8 is 8:1 -- each weight read serves 8 requests. The observed 4.7--5.8x amortization captures 59--72% of this theoretical maximum. The gap comes from three sources:

**1. Attention is per-sequence.** Even with continuous batching, the attention computation (QxK^TxV) operates on per-sequence KV-caches. Each of the 8 sequences has its own key and value tensors, which cannot be fused across sequences. The attention fraction (4--32% of GPU time, SS7) represents the non-amortizable portion.

**2. Decode-phase inefficiency.** During autoregressive decoding, each token generates a single row of activations. A batch of 8 decoding sequences produces an 8-row activation matrix -- still a relatively narrow matrix for GEMM. The GPU's SM occupancy is lower for narrow matrices, reducing compute efficiency compared to the wide matrices in prefill.

**3. Scheduling overhead.** The continuous batching scheduler (sequence tracking, token sampling, cache management) adds fixed per-iteration overhead that does not scale with batch size. This overhead is visible in the kernel count data: vLLM's kernel count at N=8 is only 5% lower than N=1 (not 87.5% lower as perfect 8:1 would predict).

Despite these inefficiencies, 59--72% amortization efficiency is remarkably high. It converts a catastrophic 82% degradation (Ollama) into a manageable 39--56% degradation -- the difference between a usable multi-agent system and an unusable one.

### SS13.3 Power Caveat

With N=3 reps per condition, the minimum detectable Cohen's d is approximately 4.3. All confirmed effects (H_1, H2) have d >> 100, well above this threshold. The verdicts are robust despite the small sample size. The H3 rejection is due to a measurement limitation (0% in all conditions), not insufficient power.

## SS14. Causal Chain -- TR129 through TR132

### SS14.1 Four-Report Progression

| TR | Finding | How This Advances Understanding |
|----|---------|--------------------------------|
| TR129 | Per-agent TPS drops 63% at N=8 (s=0.39--0.54) | Quantified the degradation |
| TR130 | vLLM/TGI scale 3--4x better than Ollama | Identified serving stacks as mitigation |
| TR131 | GPU memory bandwidth saturation is root cause | Identified the physics |
| **TR132** | **Continuous batching amortizes bandwidth 4.7--5.8x** | **Identified the mechanism** |

### SS14.2 The Complete Story

Multi-agent LLM inference degrades because GPU memory bandwidth is a fixed resource. Each token generation requires reading the full model weights from VRAM. At N=1, one request uses the bandwidth. At N=8, eight requests compete for the same bandwidth -- a fundamental physical limit (TR131).

**The Ollama path (no batching):** Each of 8 concurrent requests executes an independent kernel sequence, reading the full weight matrix from VRAM 8 times per token generation step. Ollama's ggml backend processes requests sequentially -- `max_concurrent_kernels = 1` in all conditions (TR131 SS11). The GPU serializes weight reads, and the memory controller becomes the bottleneck. Result: 82% per-agent degradation. The 8 agents collectively achieve only 1.4x the throughput of a single agent.

**The serving stack path (continuous batching):** vLLM and TGI intercept concurrent requests before they reach the GPU. Instead of dispatching 8 separate `W x x_i` matmuls, they concatenate inputs: `W x [x_1; x_2; ...; x_8]`. This single GEMM reads the weight matrix once and produces 8 outputs simultaneously. The GPU compute is slightly higher (wider matrix multiply), but the memory bandwidth is amortized 4.7--5.8x. Result: 39--56% per-agent degradation. The 8 agents collectively achieve 3.0--4.9x the throughput of a single agent.

**TR132 provides the kernel-level proof.** Per-token kernel count drops 80% (from 55--87 to 11--20 per token). Per-token memory bandwidth drops 79--83%. The amortization ratio of 4.7--5.8x directly accounts for the 26--44 pp scaling advantage of serving stacks over Ollama. This is not a scheduling optimization -- it is a fundamental change in the GPU workload pattern from independent to batched computation.

### SS14.3 The Four-Report Causal Chain -- Summary

```
TR129: "Throughput degrades 63% at N=8"
  down What causes the degradation?
TR130: "Serving stacks degrade less (39-56% vs 82%)"
  down But why? Is it scheduling? Software? Hardware?
TR131: "GPU memory bandwidth saturation is the root cause"
  down How do serving stacks avoid it?
TR132: "Continuous batching amortizes bandwidth 4.7-5.8x via kernel fusion"
  down COMPLETE -- mechanism identified
```

The causal chain is now closed. Each TR answers the question left open by its predecessor. TR129 measured the problem. TR130 found a mitigation. TR131 identified the physics. TR132 identified the mechanism. Future work shifts from diagnosis to optimization.

## SS15. Statistical Power and Data Quality

### SS15.1 Power Analysis

With N=3 repetitions per condition and alpha=0.05 (two-tailed), the minimum detectable Cohen's d at 80% power is approximately 4.3. This means only very large effects (>4 pooled standard deviations) can be detected as statistically significant.

| Metric | N per group | alpha | Min detectable d | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|-----|------------------|----------------|
| All H_1/H2 tests | 3 | 0.05 | ~4.3 | Only very large effects detectable |

### SS15.2 Observed Effect Sizes

| Test | Cohen's d | Multiple of d_min | Status |
|------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| H_1 vLLM LLaMA-1B | 1,057.9 | 246x | Far above threshold |
| H_1 vLLM LLaMA-3B | 605.5 | 141x | Far above threshold |
| H_1 TGI LLaMA-1B | 26,269.3 | 6,109x | Far above threshold |
| H_1 TGI LLaMA-3B | 1,099.1 | 256x | Far above threshold |
| H2 vLLM LLaMA-1B | 21.6 | 5.0x | Above threshold |
| H2 vLLM LLaMA-3B | 75.1 | 17.5x | Far above threshold |
| H2 TGI LLaMA-1B | 32.3 | 7.5x | Above threshold |
| H2 TGI LLaMA-3B | 100.9 | 23.5x | Far above threshold |

All confirmed effects have d >> d_min, with the smallest (H2 vLLM LLaMA-1B, d=21.6) still 5.0x above the detection threshold. The verdicts are robust despite the small sample size.

### SS15.3 Data Quality Summary

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Total profiled runs | 25 (1 validation + 24 experimental) | All successful |
| Trace capture rate | 100% (24/24) | No missing data |
| Outlier rate (Tukey IQR) | 0% across all metrics | No anomalous reps |
| Max CV% (throughput) | 0.59% (TGI LLaMA-1B N=8) | Extremely low variance |
| Mean trace size | 14.5 MB | Consistent across reps |
| Zero-variance metrics | TGI N=1 kernel counts (std=0.0) | Perfect determinism |

### SS15.4 Caveat

The small N (3 reps) means we cannot detect moderate effects (d < 4.3). If GPU utilization (H3) showed a real but moderate change (e.g., d=2), we would miss it. However, H3's rejection is due to a measurement limitation (0% in all conditions), not insufficient power -- adding more reps would not change the 0% reading. For H_1 and H2, the effects are so large that even N=2 would have been sufficient.

---

## SS16. Profiling Overhead Assessment

### SS16.1 Cross-Validation with TR130

TR130 measured serving stack throughput without nsys profiling. Comparing TR130 unprofiled results with TR132 profiled results provides an estimate of profiling overhead.

| Backend | Model | TR130 N=1 TPS (unprofiled) | TR132 N=1 TPS (profiled) | Overhead |
|---------|-------|----------------------------|--------------------------|----------|
| vLLM | LLaMA-1B | ~110* | 106.3 | ~3.4% |
| vLLM | LLaMA-3B | ~53* | 50.8 | ~4.2% |
| TGI | LLaMA-1B | ~86* | 83.7 | ~2.7% |
| TGI | LLaMA-3B | ~44* | 41.9 | ~4.8% |

*TR130 values approximate from report data; TR130 used different Docker image versions and did not use in-container nsys.

### SS16.2 Observations

**Observation 1 -- Profiling overhead is 3--5%.** The nsys CUPTI injection adds approximately 3--5% overhead to serving stack throughput. This is consistent with NVIDIA's documented nsys overhead range (1--5% for `--trace cuda`).

**Observation 2 -- Overhead is symmetric across N=1 and N=8.** Since nsys traces all CUDA activity equally regardless of concurrency level, the overhead is proportional -- it does not distort the N=1 vs N=8 ratio. The 80% kernel count reduction and 80% bandwidth reduction are measured under identical profiling conditions.

**Observation 3 -- Container-per-rep eliminates cross-contamination.** Each rep starts a fresh container with a fresh nsys instance. There is no cumulative overhead from long-running profiling sessions or growing trace buffers.

**Observation 4 -- Overhead is comparable to TR131.** TR131 reported ~0% overhead for Ollama profiling (160.4 TPS profiled vs ~160 TPS unprofiled). The slightly higher overhead for serving stacks (3--5% vs ~0%) is expected because serving stacks launch 15--25x more kernels per inference, and nsys overhead scales with kernel launch rate.

### SS16.3 Verdict

Profiling overhead is small (3--5%), symmetric across conditions, and does not affect the validity of N=1 vs N=8 comparisons. All hypothesis tests compare profiled-vs-profiled conditions, making the overhead a constant factor that cancels out.

## SS17. Limitations and Future Work

### SS17.1 What This Report Does NOT Prove

1. **We do not measure true GPU SM utilization.** The `--trace cuda` mode does not capture GPU performance counters. H3 is rejected due to measurement limitations, not evidence of no utilization change.
2. **We cannot distinguish PagedAttention from FlashAttention by kernel names alone.** H4 requires Nsight Compute source correlation.
3. **We do not compare serving stack N=1 to PyTorch Direct N=1.** H5 requires TR131 PyTorch data in a cross-referenceable format.
4. **We profile under synthetic workloads.** Fixed-length prompts (100--200 tokens) and fixed generation (128 tokens) do not represent production traffic distributions.

### SS17.2 Threats to Validity

| Type | Threat | Severity | Mitigation | Residual Risk |
|------|--------|----------|------------|---------------|
| Internal | Profiling overhead distorts throughput | Low | Container-per-rep isolation; ~3--5% overhead (SS16) | Relative comparisons unaffected; absolute TPS ~3--5% lower |
| Internal | N=3 underpowered for moderate effects | Low | All confirmed effects d >> 100 (246x above d_min) | Cannot detect effects < d=4.3; irrelevant for H_1/H2 |
| Internal | Warmup included in trace | Low | Warmup is 3 requests vs 5--24 workload (~6--12% of trace) | Early-trace kernels include model loading; slightly inflates kernel count |
| Internal | `--trace cuda` mode misses GPU metrics | High | H3 explicitly rejected due to this limitation | Cannot measure SM utilization, register pressure, or DRAM throughput |
| External | WSL2/Docker GPU path differs from native Linux | Medium | Results reflect production Docker deployments on Windows | Bare-metal Linux may show different kernel fusion patterns |
| External | Fixed prompt/generation lengths | Medium | 100--200 token prompts, 128 token generation | Production traffic has variable lengths; amortization may differ |
| External | Only 2 model sizes tested | Medium | Both show consistent patterns | Extrapolation to >7B models is untested |
| Construct | Kernel count as proxy for computational cost | Low | Corroborated by memory time reduction (independent metric) | Some kernels may vary dramatically in cost |
| Construct | Attention kernel classification from names | High | H4 explicitly marked INCONCLUSIVE | Cannot distinguish PagedAttention vs FlashAttention reliably |
| Statistical | Multiple testing (12 tests) | Low | Holm step-down correction at alpha=0.05 | 8/12 tests significant after correction; conservative |

### SS17.3 Future Work

1. **Enable GPU metrics in container**: Explore `--trace cuda,gpu_metric` with `--gpu-metrics-set` inside containers.
2. **Nsight Compute targeted profiling**: Profile individual kernels (GEMM, attention) to measure SM occupancy, register pressure, memory coalescing.
3. **Variable batch sizes**: Profile N=2, 4, 16, 32 to map the amortization curve.
4. **Production traffic patterns**: Profile with variable prompt/generation lengths matching real-world distributions.
5. **Bare-metal Linux comparison**: Compare in-container profiling with native Linux nsys to validate the WSL2 path.

## SS18. Conclusions

### SS18.1 Answers to Research Questions

**Q1: Does continuous batching reduce per-token kernel launches?**

Yes. Continuous batching reduces per-token kernel count by 77--80% at N=8. This was confirmed across all four backend-model pairs with overwhelming statistical significance (all p < 10^-6, all d > 600, all surviving Holm correction). The mechanism is kernel-level fusion: instead of launching 8 independent matrix multiplications per layer, the serving stack concatenates 8 inputs into a single batched GEMM call. The weight matrix is read once, not 8 times. This is the most direct evidence of continuous batching's computational benefit ever measured in the Banterhearts research program.

**Q2: Does continuous batching reduce per-token memory bandwidth demand?**

Yes. Per-token memory operation time drops 79--83% at N=8, confirmed across all pairs (all p < 0.001, all d > 21, all surviving Holm correction). The bandwidth reduction mirrors the kernel count reduction (correlation >0.95), confirming that fewer kernels means proportionally fewer weight reads. This is the causal link between continuous batching and the 26--44 pp scaling advantage over Ollama: batching reduces the bandwidth demand that TR131 identified as the root cause of degradation.

**Q3: Does batched serving achieve higher GPU utilization?**

Cannot determine. The `--trace cuda` profiling mode does not capture GPU performance counters (SM occupancy, utilization). GPU utilization reads 0% in all conditions -- this is a measurement limitation of the profiling configuration, not evidence of low utilization. Future work should explore `--trace cuda,gpu_metric` inside containers.

**Q4: Do PagedAttention and FlashAttention have distinct kernel signatures?**

Partially. The kernel profiles show clear structural differences: vLLM is GEMM-dominated (69--82% of GPU time) while TGI is attention-heavy (22--32% in softmax/reduce kernels). However, kernel names could not be reliably classified as "PagedAttention" vs "FlashAttention" -- both backends use CUTLASS/cuBLAS GEMM kernels for matmul, and the attention implementation is reflected in different kernel mixes rather than distinct kernel names. Nsight Compute source correlation would be needed for definitive attribution.

**Q5: Is serving-stack N=1 overhead comparable to PyTorch?**

Cannot determine. TR131 PyTorch Direct N=1 data was not available in the cross-reference dataset. The comparison with Ollama shows that serving stacks launch 15--25x more kernels at N=1 but achieve 66--81% of Ollama's throughput -- suggesting significant kernel overhead that is more than compensated by batching at N>=2.

### SS18.2 The Central Finding

**Continuous batching works by kernel-level amortization.** When 8 requests arrive concurrently, vLLM and TGI do not execute 8 independent kernel sequences. They fuse requests into shared GEMM operations, reducing per-token kernel count by 80% and per-token memory bandwidth by 80%. This 4.7--5.8x bandwidth amortization is the mechanism that gives serving stacks their 26--44 percentage-point scaling advantage over Ollama.

This finding reattributes the TR130 conclusion. TR130 stated: "the serving stack is the bottleneck, and it is Ollama that suffers." TR131 showed the bottleneck is GPU memory physics, not software. TR132 completes the picture: serving stacks don't merely "schedule better" -- they fundamentally change the GPU workload from N independent weight reads to 1 batched weight read. The scaling advantage is a consequence of bandwidth physics, not scheduling quality.

### SS18.3 Decision Tree

```
Is your workload multi-agent (N > 1)?
|-- No -> Ollama is simplest and fastest at N=1
|         (160 TPS vs 106 for vLLM, 84 for TGI)
+-- Yes -> How many agents?
    |-- N = 2-3 -> Any serving stack provides acceptable scaling
    |              vLLM retains ~70% per-agent TPS at N=2
    +-- N >= 4 -> Use vLLM or TGI (continuous batching required)
        |-- API compatibility matters? -> TGI (HuggingFace ecosystem)
        |-- Need highest throughput? -> vLLM (+20-27% vs TGI)
        +-- Model size?
            |-- <=1B -> Expect ~56% degradation at N=8 (26 pp advantage over Ollama)
            +-- >=3B -> Expect ~39% degradation at N=8 (43 pp advantage over Ollama)
```

### SS18.4 One-Number Summaries

- **5.75x**: Peak bandwidth amortization (vLLM, LLaMA-1B, N=8)
- **80%**: Per-token kernel count reduction at N=8
- **80%**: Per-token memory bandwidth reduction at N=8
- **43.5 pp**: Maximum scaling advantage over Ollama (vLLM, LLaMA-3B)
- **100%**: Trace capture success rate (24/24 profiled runs)
- **8/8**: Holm-corrected significant tests for H_1 + H2
- **48 min**: Total experiment runtime (5 phases)

### SS18.5 What Changes for the Banterhearts Research Program

1. **The degradation mechanism is now fully characterized** from measurement (TR129) through physics (TR131) to mechanism (TR132). The four-report causal chain provides complete attribution: degradation is GPU memory bandwidth saturation (TR131), and serving stacks mitigate it via kernel-level bandwidth amortization (TR132).

2. **Serving stack selection is validated** by kernel-level evidence. vLLM and TGI achieve comparable amortization (4.7--5.8x vs 4.7--4.8x); the choice between them is operational (API compatibility, deployment ecosystem), not performance-fundamental. The 20% throughput gap is a constant-factor difference, not a scaling difference.

3. **In-container nsys profiling is a reusable methodology.** Future TRs can profile any Docker-based CUDA workload on Windows using the same approach: mount Linux nsys binary, wrap entrypoint, volume-mount traces. The 100% capture rate across 24 runs validates reliability.

4. **The next frontier is optimization, not diagnosis.** The causal chain is complete. Future work should focus on:
   - Mapping the amortization curve (N=2, 4, 16, 32) to find the saturation point
   - Profiling with GPU metrics (`--trace cuda,gpu_metric`) for SM utilization data
   - Testing larger models (7B, 13B) to verify the "larger models amortize better" pattern
   - Variable-length workloads to assess amortization under production traffic distributions

## Appendix C: Statistical Methods

### Welch's t-test

Used for all pairwise N=1 vs N=8 comparisons. Does not assume equal variances. Degrees of freedom computed via Welch-Satterthwaite: df = (s1^2/n1 + s2^2/n2)^2 / [(s1^2/n1)^2/(n1-1) + (s2^2/n2)^2/(n2-1)].

### Cohen's d (pooled)

Effect size: d = (mean_a - mean_b) / pooled_std, where pooled_std = sqrt[((n1-1)*s1^2 + (n2-1)*s2^2) / (n1+n2-2)]. Thresholds: small (0.2), medium (0.5), large (0.8).

### Mann-Whitney U

Non-parametric rank-based test. Reported as confirmation alongside Welch's t. With N=3, the minimum achievable p-value is 0.05 (limited resolution).

### Holm Step-Down Correction

For k=12 hypothesis tests at family-wise alpha=0.05: sort p-values ascending, compare p(i) against alpha/(k-i+1). Reject if p(i) < threshold; stop at first non-rejection.

### Power Analysis

With N=3 per group, alpha=0.05, two-tailed: minimum detectable Cohen's d ~ 4.3 at 80% power. All confirmed effects have d >> 100, ensuring robust detection despite small N.

### IQR Outlier Detection

Tukey fences: outlier if x < Q1 - 1.5xIQR or x > Q3 + 1.5xIQR. No outliers detected in any condition (0% outlier rate across all measurements).

### Key Implementation Details

- **In-container profiling**: Linux nsys mounted at `/nsys_root/target-linux-x64:ro`; symlinked to `/tmp/nsys` (nsys requires invocation via symlink from outside `target-linux-x64/`).
- **Entrypoint wrapping**: Container uses `/bin/sh -c "ln -sf ... && exec /tmp/nsys profile --trace cuda -o /traces/{name} -- {server_cmd}"`.
- **Docker flags**: `--gpus all --init --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --security-opt seccomp=unconfined`.
- **Server entrypoints**: vLLM: `python3 -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server`; TGI: `text-generation-launcher`.
- **Container-per-rep**: Each repetition starts a fresh container for clean traces.
- **Stats export**: Windows nsys binary reads `.nsys-rep` files (cross-platform).
- **Warmup**: 3 requests before workload in each rep.
